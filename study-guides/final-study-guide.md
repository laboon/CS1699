# CS 1699 Final Exam Study Guide
NOTE - Everything on the midterm study guide is also fair game for the final!

The final will cover EVERYTHING we have learned in class this semester!

* Understand n 9's (e.g., 5 9s vs 6 9s)
* Load testing - baseline, soak/stability, stress tests
* Know different performance monitoring tools - perfmon, Activity Monitor/Instruments, top/iostat
